                                    The market potential was €25B by 2030. We
                                    designed the product in terms of UX,

                                    identified 20 clients to launch the product.

                                    sustainable growth. The client is a Virtual
                                    Reality company specialized in artistic
                                    rendition of famous landscapes on Unity.
                                    They client has developed a viable product
                                    and had some contracts with music labels and
                                    museums. However, despite the technical
                                    success, the company did not have a clear
                                    path to growth for its Series A. We worked
                                    with the CEO and CFO to pivot the strategy
                                    towards a new focus in the web3 gaming
                                    industry, providing a “universe as a
                                    service” environment that can be used by
                                    gaming studios as a base. This prove
                                    successful and, after a few validation
                                    contracts, this led to the series A being
                                    completed.

                                    Working with a mental health company to
                                    identify and integrate targets globally. The
                                    mental health market is consolidating. Our
                                    client, a leading platform in the field, had
                                    the wherewithal to take advantage of that
                                    trend to operate a build up, particularly
                                    outside of the United States. We identified
                                    in each key market – Brazil, Europe,
                                    Middle-East – what was the nature of the
                                    landscape and proceeded to assessing the
                                    potential targets. The client decided to
                                    acquire two targets. We worked with the

                                    customer and tech migration.
